# Source code to GDG Malaysia's website

Here you will find the source code that I put together, to build a simple website for GDG Malaysia. It's nothing fancy: just pure static HTML files.

It's divided into 2 main folders:
* __/static/__ - this is where all the static resources like CSS files, JavaScript files and images is located.
* __/templates/__ - this is where all the HTML template files is placed.

If you want to contribute or add pages to GDG Malaysia's website, just submit a pull request.

Fork it. 

Thanks, Naz.
